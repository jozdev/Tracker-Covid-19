<h1 align="center">Tracker Covid-19</h1>
<p align="center" style="color: #ccc;">
This project consists of the realization of an application that calculates an average of information about covid-19 in relation to the world level. Here it will be possible to obtain results of cases, deaths, recoveries at a global level, while at country level the user is asked to enter a country where he will demonstrate detailed information about the country from its appearance to those infected, deaths and recoveries the day it is viewed.

## Introduction

With the recent news about covid, the considered pandemic that caused countries to stop and caused instability at a global level, we decided to develop a project with the aim of exploring third party apis and making a global trace about the situation regarding the day and the junction of everything.
This project was developed by four computer engineering students.

 <p align="center">In this project it is possible to see all confirmed cases, deaths and recovered worldwide and there is an option for the user to enter the country that would like to obtain results on the covid-19 pandemic!
After entering a search, a result is given through an api provided by another application. It is a simple but useful covid-19 tracker that we put into practice some of our knowledge about apis.</p></p>

## TargetAudience


Being a project dealing with a global theme in relation to being a pandemic, the target audience is all users with enough curiosity to search for news on the topic.
