<h1 align="center">Tracker Covid-19</h1>
<p align="center" style="color: #ccc;">
This project consists of the realization of an application that calculates an average of information about covid-19 in relation to the world level. Here it will be possible to obtain results of cases, deaths, recoveries at a global level, while at country level the user is asked to enter a country where he will demonstrate detailed information about the country from its appearance to those infected, deaths and recoveries the day it is viewed.

## Introduction

With the recent news about covid, the considered pandemic that caused countries to stop and caused instability at a global level, we decided to develop a project with the aim of exploring third party apis and making a global trace about the situation regarding the day and the junction of everything.
This project was developed by four computer engineering students.

 <p align="center">In this project it is possible to see all confirmed cases, deaths and recovered worldwide and there is an input for the user obtain results about covid-19 country name!
After entering a search, a result is given through an api provided by another application. It is a simple but useful covid-19 tracker that we put into practice some of our knowledge about apis.</p></p>

## TargetAudience


Being a project dealing with a global theme in relation to being a pandemic, the target audience is all users with enough curiosity to search for news on the topic.
